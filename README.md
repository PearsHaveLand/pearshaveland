### About Me

I'm a software developer looking to use my powers for good. With a focus on privacy, security, and accessibility, I strive to create free applications that are high-quality, user-empowering, and sustainable. In addition, I'm a big proponent of being **more** than just your job description.

Outside the computing world, you'll often find me in the kitchen or behind the DM screen<sup>1</sup>. One of my hobbies is creating new dishes as "from scratch" as possible. If you're ever a player in one of my Dungeons and Dragons games, you're guaranteed to have some homemade snacks waiting for you!

Here's a picture of one of my most photogenic loaves of bread 😋

### What I'm Working On

Right now, I'm not working on any significant side projects. But I've been sharpening my skills with Golang with the [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/) newsletter, which I highly recommend for anyone in software development.

Thanks for scrolling through all this!

That's all for now, folks!
